# Pop Shell - WIP

The purpose of Pop Shell is to provide a keyboard driven layer for GNOME Shell that allows for quick and sensible navigation, movement, and resizing of windows.

A proposal for the feature in upstream GNOME is currently under development and will be created as a GNOME Shell GitLab issue for future discussion. Ideally this feature will be available for any environment using mutter, extending the half-monitor tiling capability currently present.
